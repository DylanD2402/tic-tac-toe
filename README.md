# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Java implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows two players to play the game in a windowed environment. The game board is displayed in a graphical window, and players take turns making their moves until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

# How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid displayed in the graphical window.

There are two players: 'X' and 'O'.

Players take turns making their moves. To make a move, click on the cell where you want to place your symbol.

The game continues until one player wins or there are no more empty cells.

# Game Rules
- To win the game, a player must have three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.

- The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled, and no player has won.

- Players take turns, and a player cannot make a move in a cell that is already occupied.

- The game displays the winner or a draw in the graphical window and asks if you want to play again.
